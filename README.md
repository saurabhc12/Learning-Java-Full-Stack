**Four Pillars of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**

*1. Encapsulation:* `Bundling data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some components for protection.`  

*2. Polymorphism:* `The ability of methods to behave differently based on context.`  

a. Method Overloading: `Same method name, different parameters.`  
b. Method Overriding: `Subclass provides its own implementation of an inherited method.`  

*3. Inheritance:* `A child class inherits properties and behaviors from a parent class, allowing code reusability.`  

*4. Abstraction:* `Hiding complex details and showing only necessary features to reduce complexity.`  

**Learned 3 type of syntax of exception handling**
*Which are as follows*
`1. try-catch
2. try-catch-finally
3. try-finally`
